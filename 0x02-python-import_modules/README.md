Exploring Python Modules and Script Arguments

This repository delves into various functionalities related to Python modules and script arguments.

Exercises:

Import a Simple Function (0-add.py):

Demonstrates importing functions from external Python files.
Showcases calling these imported functions within your code.
My First Toolbox! (1-calculation.py):

Highlights importing multiple functions from a single module.
Emphasizes performing calculations using these imported functions.
Reinforces working with various imported functions within your code.
How to Make a Script Dynamic! (2-args.py):

Focuses on handling command-line arguments passed when running the script.
Prints the number of arguments and a list of each argument provided.
Introduces concepts of dynamic script behavior based on user input.
Infinite Addition (3-infinite_add.py):

Calculates the sum of all arguments provided as input.
Prints the final sum after adding all arguments.
Emphasizes handling large numbers effectively in Python.
Who Are You? (4-hidden_discovery.py):

Analyzes a compiled Python module (provided: hidden_4.pyc).
Lists all defined names within the module, excluding those starting with __ (private members).
Sorts the output alphabetically for better readability.
Requires Python 3.8.x for compatibility.
Everything Can Be Imported (5-variable_load.py):

Illustrates importing a specific variable (a) from another file (variable_load_5.py).
Prints the value of the imported variable.
Emphasizes selective importing of variables from modules.
Key Takeaways:

Python's module system for code organization and reusability.
Importing and utilizing functions from external modules.
Handling command-line arguments to make scripts interactive.
Efficiently working with large numbers in Python.
Examining compiled modules to understand their contents.
